                        "goodAnswer": "The kidneys lie on either side of the spine in the retroperitoneal space between the parietal peritoneum and the posterior abdominal wall, well protected by muscle, fat, and ribs.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The kidneys are positioned in the peritoneal cavity, surrounded by the stomach and intestines, with minimal protective structures.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Located in the abdominal ventral cavity, kidneys have no direct attachment to the skeletal structure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The kidneys are situated below the diaphragm in the pleural cavity, providing structural support to the respiratory system."

                        "goodAnswer": "The renal fascia anchors the kidneys to the posterior abdominal wall and gives structural support.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Renal fascia is a protective layer of connective tissue that physically filters urine produced by the kidneys.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The renal fascia is involved in blood filtration and urine production.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Renal fascia functions to maintain fluid balance in the body rather than provide physical support."

                        "goodAnswer": "The adrenal glands are superior to each kidney and produce aldosterone, a hormone that regulates sodium reabsorption.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The adrenal glands are found within the kidney, secreting enzymes that contribute directly to urine composition.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Adrenal glands control blood pressure independently within the renal artery.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The adrenal cortex does not directly influence renal function but regulates heart rate instead."

                        "goodAnswer": "The renal fat pad provides shock absorption and insulation for the kidneys, helping to maintain temperature regulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The renal fat pad is responsible for producing insulin for glucose regulation in the kidneys.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The renal fat pad stores excess fluid within the kidneys and releases it during dehydration.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The renal fat pad exclusively aids in urine filtration and waste removal from the kidneys."

                        "goodAnswer": "Nephrons are responsible for filtering blood and removing waste products, thereby producing urine.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The collecting ducts are the primary functional unit of the kidney and are responsible for urine concentration.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Glomeruli act as the kidneys' primary filtration system but do not form urine by themselves.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The loop of Henle is solely involved in the reabsorption of water and salts, it doesn't engage in urine formation."
