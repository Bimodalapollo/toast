                        "goodAnswer": "Tissues are fixed with chemicals, dehydrated, infiltrated with paraffin or plastic, embedded into blocks, sectioned into thin slices, and then stained with dyes such as Hematoxylin and Eosin.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Tissues are directly observed under the microscope without any pretreatment to maintain their natural state and structure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Tissues are frozen in liquid nitrogen, then examined quickly under low-light conditions to prevent degradation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Tissues are immersed in a staining solution, then directly applied to microscope slides without prior fixation or embedding.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Tissues are initially bleached to remove all pigments and then directly viewed under an electron microscope for detailed imaging."

                        "goodAnswer": "Hematoxylin stains nucleic acids blue/purple, indicating basophilic structures, while Eosin stains acidophilic structures like proteins and membranes red/pink.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Hematoxylin and Eosin staining differentiates between various types of muscle fibers by staining them in varying shades of green and yellow.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "This staining technique enhances the visibility of lipids and carbohydrates in cells by staining these structures bright orange and black.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "H&E staining specifically marks cell organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts to be prominently visible under UV light.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The Hematoxylin and Eosin approach is used solely to enhance the contrast of viral particles within infected tissue samples, staining them bright blue."

                        "goodAnswer": "Heavy metal salts such as lead citrate and uranyl acetate bind to nucleic acids and proteins, creating contrast by blocking electrons in the microscope.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "These salts are used to preserve the tissues in their lifelike state, preventing any distortion during the imaging process.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Heavy metal salts enhance electron flow to the specimen, thus speeding up the imaging process and producing clearer images.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The salts provide a fluorescent glow to tissues, which is necessary for them to be visible under the high magnification of electron microscopes.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "They act as a cleaning agent to ensure the electron microscopeâ€™s lens remains free from dust and other contaminants during imaging."

                        "goodAnswer": "Electron microscopes use beams of electrons rather than light, providing much shorter wavelengths which result in higher resolution and magnification capabilities.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Electron microscopes utilize a series of sophisticated color filters that enhance the natural light entering the microscope, thus improving resolution.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "They increase the temperature of specimens, causing faster movement of molecules which electron microscopes can capture in real time, improving resolution.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Electron microscopes amplify the specimen's natural electric fields, which interacts with the magnetic field of the microscope to boost image clarity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The use of ultraviolet light in electron microscopes allows them to penetrate further into specimens, revealing more detailed structure."

                        "goodAnswer": "Virtual microscopy allows for the digital scanning and storage of slides which can be accessed and shared globally, with features such as zoom and image manipulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Virtual microscopes are significantly smaller and more portable than traditional microscopes, making them more suitable for fieldwork.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "They eliminate the need for any physical slides, instead using holographic projections to simulate tissue structures.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Virtual microscopy uses artificial intelligence to automatically diagnose diseases from the slides, without the need for human oversight.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Such systems are completely automated, requiring no user input or understanding of microscopy to operate effectively."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Histology focuses only on muscular and neural tissues as these are the most complex and functionally significant in most pathological conditions.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Only connective tissue is studied in detail due to its involvement in supporting, connecting, or separating different types of tissues and organs.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "The primary focus is on plant tissues like parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma due to their unique biochemical properties.",
