                        "goodAnswer": "Hypertension can be categorized into stages based on blood pressure readings; Stage 1 is typically from 130-139 systolic or 80-89 diastolic, while Stage 2 is considered 140 and above systolic or 90 and above diastolic.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Hypertension is generally recognized as a single sustained condition with a blood pressure of 120/80 or higher.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Depending on the condition of the patient, hypertension stages are only recognized during a physical examination or diagnostics that identify pressures exactly at 130/85.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Hypertension is classified into mild, moderate, and severe stages, corresponding to specific cholesterol levels and kidney function tests.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The stages of hypertension are dynamically set during medication treatment, adjusting as the patient's overall weight and diet vary."

                        "goodAnswer": "Malignant hypertension is a severe form of high blood pressure that rapidly progresses and causes damage to critical organs such as the brain, heart, and kidneys, often manifesting through symptoms like stroke and renal failure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Malignant hypertension refers to the chronic stage of hypertension where symptoms are managed through continuous medication, having little impact on organs if treated early.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Hypertension is often called the 'silent killer' because it usually has no noticeable symptoms until serious damage occurs, detectable only through regular blood pressure monitoring.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "It is termed as such because it mainly affects people during sleep, with symptoms like excessive snoring and long periods of silence.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The 'silent killer' nickname originates from the fact that hypertension typically results in a sudden and unnoticeable death.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Hypertension is known as the 'silent killer' because it cannot be diagnosed or treated, leading to a high mortality rate.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "This name is due to the condition's ability to remain dormant and undetected in clinical tests, often misdiagnosed as anxiety or stress."

                        "goodAnswer": "Excessive contraction during systole, which can yield a very high ESPVR, may lead to an overly forceful ejection of blood, raising blood pressure, particularly noted in young, otherwise fit individuals.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "It leads to a decrease in blood pressure by allowing more blood to flow through dilated arteries without resistance.",

                        "wrongAnswer_3": "This contraction phase helps to stabilize blood pressure by systematically adjusting blood viscosity and arterial wall tension.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Excessive contraction during systole primarily assists in lowering heart rate and has little effect on hypertension."

                        "goodAnswer": "A high intravascular volume increases venous return, causing the heart to eject larger blood volumes into the arterial system, thereby elevating blood pressure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Increased intravascular volume lowers blood pressure by diluting blood consistency and reducing arterial resistance.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "It causes hypertension by significantly decreasing the heart's ejection fraction, leading to poor blood circulation.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "A high intravascular volume helps stabilize hypertension by facilitating better hydration and decreasing blood osmolarity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "This condition actually indicates a hypothesized mechanism but is rarely seen in newly diagnosed patients with hypertension who often have a contracted intravascular volume."

                        "goodAnswer": "An elevated venous tone can increase LVEDV even with a normal or low blood volume, potentially rising blood pressure through enhanced venous return.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Reduction in venous tone is directly linked to a decrease in hypertension by promoting faster blood clearance from arterial pathways.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Venous tone has a negligible effect on blood pressure as it mostly impacts vascular filling phases, not resistance",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Increased venous tone lowers hypertension risk by enhancing blood storage capacity in the veins, thus decreasing load on the heart.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Venous tone primarily influences oxygen saturation levels in blood, indirectly affecting hypertension through metabolic rates."

                        "goodAnswer": "High Ea, due either to increased arterial resistance or decreased compliance, causes higher pressures for any given stroke volume, raising systolic blood pressure in particular.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "A lower Ea typically indicates higher arterial flexibility, which can diminish hypertension by enabling smoother blood transit.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Effective arterial elastance has a variable impact, sometimes lowering blood pressure by increasing arterial diameter and flow rate.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Ea affects only venous return and does not contribute directly to hypertension, which is more influenced by hormonal factors.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Fluctuations in Ea are generally temporary and do not significantly influence long-term trends in hypertension."

                        "goodAnswer": "Diuretics decrease blood pressure primarily by reducing intravascular volume, thus lowering blood volume and venous return, ultimately decreasing cardiac output and arterial pressure.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "They increase blood viscosity, which in turn reduces the systemic vascular resistance and thus lowers blood pressure.",

                        "goodAnswer": "Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the cells of the heart and blood vessel walls, leading to lower heart rates and relaxation of vessels, which reduces blood pressure.",
