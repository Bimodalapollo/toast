            "question": "What are the primary physiologic functions of prostaglandins in the human body?",
            "goodAnswer": "Prostaglandins play significant roles in temperature regulation, maintaining gastric and renal cytoprotection, regulating intestinal mobility, myometrial and seminal function, and modulating inflammation through renin secretion.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Prostaglandins solely function in digestion, aiding in the breakdown and absorption of nutrients within the gut.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The main function of prostaglandins is to mediate foreign body responses, primarily triggering immune reactions against pathogens.",

          {
            "question": "What pathological effects do prostaglandins have during inflammation?",
            "goodAnswer": "During inflammation, prostaglandins like PGE2 can cause pain, hyperalgesia, heat, and increase vascular permeability leading to edema.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "In pathological conditions, they have no major role other than increasing vascular permeability insignificantly.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The pathological function of prostaglandins is confined to decreasing neurotransmitter release in nervous tissue.",
