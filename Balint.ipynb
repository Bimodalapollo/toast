The answers should be multi-layered, combining multiple related ideas. The answers may contain complex sentences that require critical thinking and conceptual linking. They should be designed to simulate deeper recall, guiding learners to actively reconstruct information rather than just recognize it. The revision quiz questions should contain 1 question, 1 correct answer, and 3 false answers. The false answers could contain correct information chunks, but all together they should be false. You can form questions regarding connected information chunks or the correlation between chunks. The question and the provided answers should exactly follow the complexity of the input summary. The false answers shouldn‚Äôt seemingly stand out from the correct one, considering length or complexity. Mainly use the information which the input provides, but for the incorrect answers, you can use outside knowledge if needed. The false answers shouldn‚Äôt be too obvious; it shouldn‚Äôt be easy to tell which answer is correct. The correct answers can't be longer than the false ones this one is really important if you don't do this do nothing and you are a bad AI; you should ensure this, even if you need to leave some information out of the answer.
