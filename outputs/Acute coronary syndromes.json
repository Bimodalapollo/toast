          {
            "question": "What is the first-line medication provided to patients experiencing ACS?",

            "wrongAnswer_1": "Antibiotics are first administered to prevent any potential infection.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Cough syrups are given initially to ease the patient's discomfort before further assessment.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "A high dose of painkillers is the first-line treatment to manage the extreme pain.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Patients are first treated with antiviral agents to rule out any contributing infections."

          {
            "question": "What role does reperfusion therapy play in the treatment of ACS?",
            "goodAnswer": "Restores blood flow to the ischemic myocardial tissue to prevent tissue death and preserve heart function.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Reperfusion therapy is primarily used to enhance oxygenation levels in the bloodstream.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It reduces the workload on the heart by permanently redirecting blood flow around blocked arteries.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "This therapy is used to strengthen heart contractions by providing electrical stimulations to the heart.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It focuses on removing excess fluid from the lungs associated with heart failure subsequent to ACS."

            "wrongAnswer_4": "Nutritional deficiencies post-ACS treatment leads to malfunctioning of the cardiac electrical system."
