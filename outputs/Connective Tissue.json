            "question": "What are the primary functions of connective tissue in the human body?",
            "goodAnswer": "Provides architectural framework, binds tissues, offers mechanical support, stores and transports substances, and plays a role in wound repair and inflammatory response.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "It mainly provides insulation and reserve energy sources through fat storage and metabolism.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Its sole function is to support the nervous system by forming a protective myelin sheath around neurons.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Connective tissue primarily functions to facilitate muscle contraction and bone movement.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "It transports gases like oxygen and carbon dioxide to and from the lungs and cells."

            "question": "What are the three main types of fibers found in connective tissue and what are their primary functions?",
            "goodAnswer": "Collagen fibers provide tensile strength, elastic fibers allow tissues to stretch and recoil, and reticular fibers form a soft internal skeleton (stroma).",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Myosin and actin fibers, responsible for movements and cellular support.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Neurofibrillary fibers, which facilitate rapid signal transmission.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Capillary fibers that function primarily to aid in the transport of blood.",

            "question": "What role do glycosaminoglycans play in the extracellular matrix of connective tissue?",
            "goodAnswer": "They are highly hydrophilic and help manage water content and facilitate nutrient diffusion.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Their main function is to initiate blood coagulation and clotting processes.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Act primarily as catalyzers for speed up chemical reactions between cells.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Are involved in the transmission of nerve impulses across connective tissues.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "They store genetic information for cell division and tissue growth."

            "question": "What is the composition and function of the basement membrane in connective tissue?",
            "goodAnswer": "Consists of glycosaminoglycans, fibrous proteins like collagen types IV and VII, and structural glycoproteins, providing support and filtration.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "It mainly consists of hemoglobin and myoglobin for oxygen transport.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Primarily composed of elastic fibers that allow lungs and arteries to expand and contract.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Constructed solely from adipose cells to store fatty acids and energy.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Made up of neural cells to enable rapid signal transmission across the nervous system."

            "question": "Identify the fixed and free cells found in connective tissue and describe their functions.",
            "goodAnswer": "Fixed cells include fibroblasts and adipocytes, involved in fiber production and fat storage, respectively; free cells such as lymphocytes participate in immune response.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Fixed cells, like neurons, transmit signals; free cells, like platelets, aid in clotting.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Only fixed cells known as osteocytes are present which help in bone maintenance.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Free cells are erythrocytes transporting oxygen; no fixed cells are present in connective tissues.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Fixed cells are endothelial that line blood vessels, with no free cells in this tissue."

            "goodAnswer": "Loose connective tissue fills spaces between organs; dense, irregular connective tissue is in dermis; dense, regular collagenous tissue is in tendons and ligaments.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Only one type exists, which is homogeneously distributed throughout the body.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Two types: soft connective found in the brain and hard connective in bones, with static functions.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Multiple types, primarily found in the upper epidermis and hair follicles, for protective functions.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Connective tissues are only classified as muscular and neural, based on location and function."
