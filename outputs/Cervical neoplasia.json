                        "goodAnswer": "Dysplastic cells typically have an increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, darker and more irregular nuclei, and larger cytoplasm with small pyknotic nuclei.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Dysplastic cells are often larger than normal with a reduced nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio and very regular, light nuclei.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Cervical dysplasia is mainly characterized by a decrease in cytoplasmic volume and a very high level of nuclear uniformity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Cells affected by dysplasia usually show a decreased nuclear size and increased cytoplasm with no impact on the nucleus' regularity.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Dysplastic cells in the cervix are identified by a high cytoplasmic ratio, small and dark nuclei, with minimal changes to the epithelial surface texture."

                        "goodAnswer": "A koilocytotic change indicates a human papillomavirus infection and involves the vacuolization of epithelial cells.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Koilocytotic changes are benign and reflect normal variances in cervical cell morphology with no link to HPV.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "This change points to bacterial infection rather than viral, and koilocytotic changes are treated with antibiotics.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "Such changes indicate severe inflammation but are not directly linked to any specific kind of viral infection.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "Koilocytotic changes suggest an autoimmune response rather than an infectious disease, affecting the cervical epithelium."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Pap smears are primarily used to detect fungal infections like Aspergillus and are not effective against viral or bacterial infections.",

                        "goodAnswer": "The exfoliation process in a Pap smear is mechanically enhanced using tools such as spatulas or brushes to collect cells from epithelial surfaces.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Exfoliation is solely chemical, using acids to retrieve cells without any mechanical instruments involved.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "The process employs high-frequency vibrations to loosen cells, after which they are collected by suction.",

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Main risk factors are limited to genetic predisposition and long-term use of oral contraceptives without HPV playing a significant role.",

                        "goodAnswer": "HPV types 16 and 18 are strongly implicated in the development of cervical and other anogenital cancers due to their role in the alteration of host cell DNA which can lead to carcinogenesis.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "HPV has a protective role against cervical cancers by enhancing cellular immunity specifically in the anogenital region.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "Although commonly associated with cervical conditions, HPV is not directly linked to cancers but rather to benign genital warts.",
                        "wrongAnswer_3": "HPV only contributes to cervical dysplasia, with other factors like diet and hygiene playing more critical roles in cancer development.",
                        "wrongAnswer_4": "The virus has an indirect relationship where it leads to nutritional deficiencies that then pave the way for anogenital cancers."

                        "wrongAnswer_1": "Staging is based from Stage I to Stage III only, focusing on tumor size and ignoring metastatic spread.",

                        "goodAnswer": "LEEP uses a wire loop with an electrical current running through it, acting like a surgeon's knife to excise abnormal cervical tissue, effectively removing areas of precancer.",
                        "wrongAnswer_1": "The LEEP technique involves freezing the precancerous cells using a cold loop, relying on low temperatures rather than electrical current.",
                        "wrongAnswer_2": "This procedure uses a loop made of lasers to burn away abnormal cells without any physical cutting.",
