            "question": "What percentage range does Gestational Hypertension typically affect pregnant women?",
            "goodAnswer": "Gestational hypertension affects approximately 6-7% of pregnant women and involves the onset of hypertension without proteinuria after 20 weeks of gestation.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Gestational hypertension is seen in about 10-15% of pregnancies and only occurs in the first trimester.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Chronic hypertension affects 6-7% of all pregnancies and includes high blood pressure present before pregnancy or before 20 weeks of gestation.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Gestational hypertension can affect up to 20% of all pregnant women, usually starting in the first 20 weeks and often continuing postpartum.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Preeclampsia, affecting 6-7% of pregnancies, involves high blood pressure and significant levels of protein in the urine after 20 weeks of gestation."

            "question": "What distinguishes superimposed preeclampsia from chronic hypertension in pregnancy?",
            "goodAnswer": "Superimposed preeclampsia involves chronic hypertension with new onset proteinuria or other preeclampsia symptoms during pregnancy.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Superimposed preeclampsia is a mild form of chronic hypertension without additional symptoms occurring during pregnancy.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "There is no difference; both terms describe high blood pressure before 20 weeks of gestation that improves after delivery.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Chronic hypertension refers to high blood pressure that resolves after pregnancy, while superimposed preeclampsia does not improve postpartum.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Both conditions are identical but superimposed preeclampsia is diagnosed only when blood pressure exceeds 160/110 mmHg."

            "question": "What are the primary symptoms used to classify severe preeclampsia?",
            "goodAnswer": "Severe preeclampsia symptoms include blood pressure of 160/110 mmHg or higher, proteinuria greater than 5gm in 24 hours, oliguria, and visual disturbances.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Mild preeclampsia symptoms, such as a slight increase in blood pressure and minimal proteinuria, are used to classify severe preeclampsia.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Severe preeclampsia is classified by persistent headaches, mild proteinuria, and blood pressure consistently below 140/90 mmHg.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Symptoms such as slight edema, occasional high blood pressure readings, and trace levels of protein in urine define severe preeclampsia.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "The classification includes low blood pressure, absence of proteinuria, and no changes in vision or liver function."

            "question": "What differentiates mild from severe preeclampsia?",
            "goodAnswer": "Mild preeclampsia involves blood pressure at or above 140/90 mmHg with 300mg of proteinuria, whereas severe includes much higher blood pressure and additional systemic symptoms.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Mild and severe preeclampsia are differentiated only by the patient's subjective feeling of wellness.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "There is no clinical difference between mild and severe preeclampsia, only the timing of onset varies.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Mild preeclampsia becomes severe only when blood pressure exceeds 180/110 mmHg without other symptoms.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Severe preeclampsia is classified as such when there is no detectable proteinuria and extremely high blood pressure."

            "question": "What is the recommended position and method for measuring blood pressure in pregnant women?",
            "goodAnswer": "Blood pressure in pregnant women should be measured in a comfortable sitting position using the Korotkoff V sound; alternatively, Korotkoff IV can be noted if V is not audible.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "The standing position is recommended to get an accurate measure of diastolic pressure by using the Korotkoff V sound.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It's best measured while the patient is lying down using the highest sound of Korotkoff to determine systolic pressure.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Patients should be measured in a prone position using the Korotkoff I sound for the most precise reading.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Blood pressure is optimally measured in a squatting position using the fourth Korotkoff sound for all readings."
          },
          {
            "question": "What is the significance of using Korotkoff V sound over Korotkoff IV in pregnancy?",
            "goodAnswer": "The Korotkoff V sound provides a more accurate measurement of diastolic pressure, crucial for diagnosing and managing pregnancy-induced hypertension.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Korotkoff IV is preferred as it offers a faster measurement for high stress scenarios commonly encountered in pregnancy.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "There is no difference in measuring Korotkoff IV or V in pregnancy as both provide identical outcomes in hypertension management.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Korotkoff IV is particularly used to measure systolic pressure, not diastolic, and is therefore less useful in pregnancy.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Using Korotkoff V is less accurate and is only used when sound IV cannot be determined by auscultation."
