            "question": "What is the difference between the visceral and parietal pleura in terms of their innervation and function?",
            "goodAnswer": "The visceral pleura is highly sensitive to pain, while the parietal pleura insensate but secretes serous fluid to reduce friction during breathing.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Only the parietal pleura has sensory nerves and serves to expand the thoracic cavity during each breath.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The visceral pleura is thick and provides structural support to lung lobes, whereas the parietal pleura remains a thin, transparent membrane for gas exchange.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Both layers absorb oxygen from the environment, but the parietal pleura releases carbon dioxide directly into the bloodstream.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Visceral pleura thickness varies among individuals, while the parietal pleura remains a uniform thickness and plays a role in hormonal regulation in some cases."

            "question": "What is the primary function of the pleural fluid that fills the pleural cavity?",
            "goodAnswer": "Pleural fluid lubricates the pleural membranes, preventing friction during breathing movements.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "This fluid acts as an additional barrier to gas exchange and minimizes airflow through the trachea and bronchioles.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "It primarily neutralizes excess mucus secreted by the bronchial glands rather than serving as a lubricant.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Pleural fluid provides mechanical stability to lung lobes, ensuring that each lobe remains fixed in place despite pressure changes.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Phagocytes in the pleural space actively break down foreign particles that enter the respiratory tract, clearing the airways and preventing infections."

          {
            "question": "How does pneumothorax occur, and what role does the pleura play in its development?",
            "goodAnswer": "Pneumothorax results from an accumulation of air in the pleural space, creating a positive pressure gradient and causing lung collapse.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Changes in atmospheric pressure lead to spontaneous lung deflation, and the pleura insulates the collapsed lung from surrounding structures.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "Lack of pleural fluid accelerates the formation of a collapsed lung, allowing air to seep into the subpleural cavity.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "Pulmonary embolisms disrupt the continuity of the visceral pleura, leading to a release of gases during each breath and impeding normal oxygen uptake.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Sudden shifts in thoracic muscle tone compress the lungs, forcing air to escape the alveoli and accumulate within the pleural sinuses, which subsequently leads to lung deflation."

          {
            "question": "Why is pleuritis often accompanied by breathing difficulty?",
            "goodAnswer": "Inflamed pleural membranes may produce excess fluid or fibrous adhesions, restricting lung expansion and preventing normal diaphragmatic contraction.",
            "wrongAnswer_1": "Pleuritis directly affects the bronchi, leading to chronic bronchospasms and changes in airflow resistance, but it does not impact lung volume directly.",
            "wrongAnswer_2": "The primary symptom of pleuritis is severe chest pain, suggesting neurological, rather than respiratory, involvement in the condition.",
            "wrongAnswer_3": "This condition results from overpressure of the alveoli, forcing bronchial secretions into the pleural cavity and disrupting gas exchange.",
            "wrongAnswer_4": "Fever, not respiratory impairment, is the most common presentation of pleuritis, implying its infectious rather than mechanical nature."
